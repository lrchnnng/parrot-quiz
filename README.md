## UX 
Whilst designing and creating this website I have taken into account the five planes of UX design, strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface.

### Strategy
I began by creating the foundation for my website, I defined my target user and the types of features and technologies. 

Target users for Parrots Parrots Parrots!:
* Ages 10 +
* Parrot lovers
* People who want to learn more about parrots

First time and returning user goals: 
* To learn about different species of parrots.
* To test current knowledge of various parrot species.
* To acesses high scores from previous test attempts.

Another goal for my website was to create an intuitive experience making the page easy to navigate without the user having to think too much about their next move. With the understanding that my user demographic is most likely viewing the website across a variety of devices, I have made sure that the site is fully responsive across screen sizes in order to optimize user experience.

### Scope
The second plane of UX looks at the **scope** of the website. What does the user have to do in order to reach the goals for the website. Do they need to search? Do they need to sign up to a newsletter? The important part of this phase is looking at what specific features I will include in order to meet both user and business goals.

#### Features

### Structure
I created a userflow diagram to show how the user will interact with each page on the site.

### Skeleton
The **skeleton** plane of UX design is a more visual representation of the flow in which a user might use the website. Using wireframes to show a basic design layout 
removes colour, Typography, imagery to create a basic view of website and layout
