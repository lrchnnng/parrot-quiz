## 2. UX 

Whilst designing and creating this website I have taken into account the five planes of UX design, strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface.

### 2.1 Strategy
This plane is the first, it involves identifying the goals and objectives of the site and the user. By identifying these first, design decisions can be made that meet these goals.

**User and site goals**
Target users for Parrots Parrots Parrots!:
* Ages 10 +
* Parrot lovers
* People who want to learn more about parrots

First time and returning user goals: 
* To easily and intuitively access different pages of the site.
* To learn about different species of parrots.
* To test current knowledge of various parrot species.
* To gain a fun fact once final score has been displayed.
* Access social media pages related to the site.

One of the main goals for my website was to create an intuitive experience making the page easy to navigate without the user having to think too much about their next move. With the understanding that my user demographic is most likely viewing the website across a variety of devices, I have made sure that the site is fully responsive across screen sizes in order to optimize user experience.

### 2.2 Scope
The second plane of UX looks at the **scope** of the website. What does the user have to do in order to reach both the user and the site owners goals for the website.

### 2.3 Structure
The structure plane deals with the organising and arrangment of elements within the user interface. Creating userflows to define how the user will interact with the page. A big goal of the structure plane is to ensure that the users can easily find and access the information they need.

I created a userflow diagram to show how the user will interact with each page on the site.
While I had originally planned for the user to lose a point when they answered the question incorrectly, I chose to change this to make it a more fun experience to a younger audience.

### 2.4 Skeleton
This plane is a more refined view of the user interface. Looking at the layout and visual hierarchy to ensure the site is both visually appealing and functional. I created a set of wireframes for different screen sizes, this is a simplified version of the final product, removing colour, typography, imagery to create a basic view of website and establish the layout.

| Mobile Wireframes | Desktop Wireframes |
|:---:|:---:|
|![Mobile Wireframes](assets/images/readme-img/mobile-wireframes.png)|![Tablet and Desktop Wireframes](assets/images/readme-img/tablet-wireframes.png)|

*Note: Some areas have changed between the wireframes and the final product, this is either due to making the page easier to navigate or an added function later in development.*


### 2.5 Surface
The surface plane is the last layer and deals with the aesthetics of the user interface. This includes colour palettes, typography, graphics and visual style. The goal of this plane is to create a page that is visually pleasing and engaging for the user.

| Type | Image | Description|
|:---:|---|---|
|Typography|![google fonts](assets/images/readme-img/google-font.png)| I opted to use 'Montserrat' across the entire site as it is a simple and easy to read font that has a number of different style options that can be utilised in different areas. |
|Colours|![Colour Palette](assets/images/readme-img/quiz-colours.png)|I chose to use a simple primary colour palette to keep the pages looking clean and easy to read.|
|Photography|![Sample image of a parrot](assets/images/main-img/irn.jpg)|I used royalty free images of parrots from google images.|
