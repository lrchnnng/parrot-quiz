## 2. UX 

</div>
Whilst designing and creating this website I have taken into account the five planes of UX design, strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface.

### 2.1 Strategy
I began by creating the foundation for my website, I defined my target user and the types of features and technologies. 

Target users for Parrots Parrots Parrots!:
* Ages 10 +
* Parrot lovers
* People who want to learn more about parrots

First time and returning user goals: 
* To learn about different species of parrots.
* To test current knowledge of various parrot species.
* To gain a fun fact once final score has been displayed.

Another goal for my website was to create an intuitive experience making the page easy to navigate without the user having to think too much about their next move. With the understanding that my user demographic is most likely viewing the website across a variety of devices, I have made sure that the site is fully responsive across screen sizes in order to optimize user experience.

### 2.2 Scope
The second plane of UX looks at the **scope** of the website. What does the user have to do in order to reach both the user and the site owners goals for the website.

#### Features <!-- omit in toc -->
- **Homepage:**
A simple landing page with a nav bar and navigation buttons to other pages on the site.
- **How to play:**
A page that explains how the quiz will work, includes a navigation button to begin the quiz.
- **Quiz:**
An interactive quiz page with an image as the question and four options for the user to choose from.
- **Scores:**
A page that takes the score from the quiz and displays the final user score, a short message and a random fun fact about parrots once the quiz is finished.

### 2.3 Structure
I created a userflow diagram to show how the user will interact with each page on the site.
While I had originally planned for the user to lose a point when they answered the question incorrectly, I chose to change this to make it a more fun experience to a younger audience.

</details>

### 2.4 Skeleton
The **skeleton** plane of UX design is a more visual representation of the flow in which a user might use the website. Using wireframes to show a basic design layout 
removes colour, Typography, imagery to create a basic view of website and layout

**Mobile Wireframes**

</details>

**Tablet and Desktop Wireframes**

</details>

These wireframes are a simplified version of what I planned for the site. Some areas may have changed between the wireframes and the final product.


### 2.5 Surface

#### Typography <!-- omit in toc -->
I opted to use 'Montserrat' across the entire site as it is a simple and easy to read font that has a number of different style options that can be utilised in different areas.

#### Colours <!-- omit in toc -->
I chose to use a simple primary colour palette to keep the pages looking clean and easy to read.

#### Photography <!-- omit in toc -->
I used royalty free images of parrots from google images.
